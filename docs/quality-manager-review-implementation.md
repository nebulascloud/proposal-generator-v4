# Quality Manager Review Implementation Summary

## Overview
We've successfully replaced the multi-assistant review approach with a dedicated Quality Manager role to handle section reviews in the proposal generator app. This change aims to reduce token usage (previously ~3.5m tokens) while maintaining high-quality feedback and the customer feedback loop.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Added Quality Manager Role
- Created a comprehensive Quality Manager role definition in `assistantDefinitions.js`
- The role covers expertise in strategy, sales, technology, delivery, and commercial aspects
- Configured to provide structured feedback and only ask high-value questions

### 2. Modified Review Process in `flowAgent.js`
- Removed multi-assistant review process that was causing excessive token usage
- Implemented a streamlined Quality Manager review for each section
- Maintained the customer feedback loop and revision process
- Ensured structured review format with clear feedback

### 3. Updated Test Files
- Updated `flow.test.js` to accommodate the new review structure
- Modified test environment mocks in `flowAgent.js` to use the new structure

### 4. Fixed Issues
- Fixed the final approval section that was referencing undefined variables
- Ensured all tests are passing

## Expected Benefits
- Reduced token usage (expected to be under 1m tokens for a complete proposal)
- Maintained quality of feedback through comprehensive review by a qualified Quality Manager
- Simplified review process with a single reviewer instead of multiple specialists
- Preserved the customer feedback loop and revision process

## Next Steps
- Monitor token usage in production
- Gather feedback on the Quality Manager review quality
- Further optimize if necessary

## Branch Information
- All changes are on the feature branch: `feature/quality-manager-reviews`
- Ready for code review and approval
