# Branch Strategy and Review Process Evolution

This document outlines the evolution of our review process implementation and explains our branching strategy.

## Branch Evolution

1. **feature/enhanced-review-process**:
   - Initial implementation of an enhanced review process
   - Used a multi-assistant approach where multiple specialist assistants reviewed each section
   - Led to excessive token usage (~3.5m tokens for a complete proposal)
   - Has been archived as `archive/enhanced-review-process` tag for historical reference

2. **feature/quality-manager-reviews**:
   - Replaced multi-assistant review with a dedicated Quality Manager role
   - Built upon learnings from the enhanced-review-process implementation
   - Successfully reduced token usage while maintaining quality feedback
   - This approach was merged into `main`

## Why We Chose the Quality Manager Approach

After implementing and testing the multi-assistant review process (in `feature/enhanced-review-process`), we discovered that having every assistant review each section led to:

1. Excessive token usage (~3.5m tokens per proposal)
2. Redundant feedback across different specialists
3. System timeouts due to the complexity and volume of review data

The Quality Manager approach addresses these issues by:

1. Centralizing review responsibility to a single well-qualified assistant
2. Significantly reducing token usage (target: under 1m tokens)
3. Maintaining comprehensive review quality through a role with cross-functional expertise
4. Preserving the valuable customer feedback loop

This approach provides the benefits of thorough review while avoiding the performance and cost issues of the multi-assistant approach.

## Branch Management

- We've tagged the `feature/enhanced-review-process` branch as `archive/enhanced-review-process` for reference
- The `feature/quality-manager-reviews` branch has been merged into `main`
- Both approaches are documented in the `/docs` folder for future reference

## Future Considerations

- Monitor token usage with the Quality Manager approach
- Gather feedback on review quality
- Consider further optimizations if needed
